# Taxi-V2-Q-Learning

## Overview
Agen must pick up the passenger at one location and drop him off to the goal as fast as possible. It requires to build a reinforcement learning agent using the Taxi-3 Gym environment and demonstrate its learned behavior on a real Cozmo robot.

### Objective
The main goal is to implement and optimize a reinforcement learning algorithm that allows the taxi robot to navigate a simulated taxi environment, pick up a passenger, and then apply this learning to the real-world Cozmo robot picking up its cube.

## Getting Started

1. **Taxi-3 Gym Environment**: Begin by understanding the provided implementation of a reinforcement learning agent based on the Q-learning policy of the Taxi-3 Gym environment. The environment consists of a taxi car, 4 possible destinations, and 5 possible human locations. There are 500 possible states and 6 possible actions.

2. **Cozmo Robot Setup**: Demonstrate the learned behavior in a physical environment using a real Cozmo robot.
   - If you used Google Collab for the first step, switch to another IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
   - Connect to Cozmo's Wi-Fi and install the Cozmo API.
   - Use the provided code snippets to control the robot's movements.

3. **Simplify the Taxi-3 Gym Environment**: Modify the environment to have only 32 possible states, corresponding to 16 grid locations, 2 passenger locations, and 1 destination. Optimize the agent's performance for both simulated and real-world scenarios.
